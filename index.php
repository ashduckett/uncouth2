                    after something more substantial such as a web application or a phone app, it's very likely that Uncouth will be able to help.

                    It's important to me not to overcharge people and for respect to run both ways. Before a design is put together I'll get you a quote and you 
                    won't be obligated to spend a penny until you've approved the design and work has begun. Uncouth is about giving back some humanity to a 
                    capitalist world and if you're not happy, I invite you to tell me every step of the way.

                    I don't work nine to five. Those are the hours I am contactable, but I often work into the night and will often be up late either working on 
                    your project or learning the next big thing to use in your project. I am constantly learning whether it's around backend NodeJS web API 
                    implementation, or how to get your images to animate, and as a dynamic developer, I'll find a way to get you what you need.

                    Two reasons. The first is because I'm tired of rude people. The second is because I believe you should make your mark on the world, and with
                    your digital presence, even if some believe you to be uncouth whilst you're doing it. Go on. Be Uncouth. The world isn't all in code and I find it's extremely important
                    to remember that the reason you want something digitised is so that your analogue life can be more pleasant.

                        If you're after something entirely separate from WordPress then look no further. Uncouth Studios takes as much pride in the code that gets
                        written to produce a site as it does the presentation of the site on your screen. I am very happy to write the front-end and the back-end of
                        a website entirely from scratch if that's what you are looking for and, of course, it'll be entirely responsive so it'll look great on mobile,
                        as well as the big screen.

                If you're looking to take advantage of WordPress's dashboard so that you can more easily make updates, or write a blog, then this too is
                an option. Websites will be hand-crafted by Uncouth initially, and WordPress can then be integrated to provide an easy-to-update and
                cost-effective way for you to keep your clients up-to-date.
